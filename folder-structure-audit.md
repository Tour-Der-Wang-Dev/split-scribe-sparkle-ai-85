# Folder Structure Audit

## Current Structure Analysis

The project currently follows a fairly standard React application structure with separation by technical concerns:

```
/src
  /components
    /ui
  /hooks
  /integrations
    /supabase
  /lib
  /pages
  /services
```

## Strengths

1. **Clear technical separation**: The current structure separates code by technical role (components, services, hooks, etc.)
2. **UI component isolation**: UI components are properly isolated in a dedicated folder
3. **Service abstraction**: Business logic is properly abstracted into service files

## Areas for Improvement

1. **Large component directory**: All components are in a flat structure within `/components`
2. **Service organization**: Services are growing and could benefit from domain-based organization
3. **Missing feature-based organization**: As the app grows, organizing by technical role alone becomes less effective
4. **Lack of shared types**: No dedicated location for shared TypeScript interfaces and types
5. **Test organization**: No clear structure for test files

## Recommendations

### 1. Introduce Feature/Domain-based Organization

Restructure the application to group related files by feature/domain:

```
/src
  /core           # Core application code used across features
    /components
    /hooks
    /lib
    /types
  /features       # Feature-specific code
    /prompt-engineering
      /components
      /hooks
      /services
      /types
    /groq-integration
      /components
      /hooks
      /services
      /types
    /response-management
      /components
      /hooks
      /services
      /types
  /pages          # Page components that compose features
  /ui             # Shared UI components
  /lib            # Shared utilities and helper functions
  /api            # API integration layer
    /groq
    /supabase
```

### 2. Further Organize Components

Break down the components directory by purpose:

```
/src
  /components
    /layout           # Layout components (containers, grids, etc.)
    /forms            # Form-related components
    /feedback         # Notifications, alerts, etc.
    /data-display     # Components that display data
    /navigation       # Navigation-related components
```

### 3. Establish Clear Type Definitions

Create a dedicated directory for shared TypeScript types:

```
/src
  /types
    /api.ts           # API-related types
    /models.ts        # Domain model types
    /props.ts         # Common component prop types
    /responses.ts     # API response types
```

### 4. Test Organization

Adopt a consistent approach to test file organization:

**Option 1: Co-locate tests with implementation files**
```
/src/features/prompt-engineering
  /components
    PromptEditor.tsx
    PromptEditor.test.tsx
```

**Option 2: Mirror directory structure in a test directory**
```
/src
  /features/...
/test
  /features
    /prompt-engineering
      /components
        PromptEditor.test.tsx
```

### 5. Consolidate Services

Group related services by domain:

```
/src/services
  /prompt
    TemplateService.ts
    VariableService.ts
  /ai
    GroqService.ts
    ResponseService.ts
  /storage
    LocalStorageService.ts
    FileService.ts
```

## Implementation Plan

1. **Short-term (minimal disruption)**:
   - Create subdirectories within `/components` to better organize them
   - Establish a `/types` directory for shared types
   - Group related services within the services directory

2. **Medium-term**:
   - Begin restructuring into feature-based organization
   - Move components and services to their respective feature modules
   - Update imports throughout the codebase

3. **Long-term**:
   - Complete migration to feature-based architecture
   - Establish consistent patterns for cross-feature communication
   - Document the new structure for future contributors

## Conclusion

The current structure is functional but could be improved to support future growth. A gradual transition toward a feature-based organization while maintaining clear separation of concerns will improve maintainability and developer experience as the application continues to evolve.

Recommendations are prioritized based on effort and impact, with the most critical improvements highlighted for immediate implementation.
